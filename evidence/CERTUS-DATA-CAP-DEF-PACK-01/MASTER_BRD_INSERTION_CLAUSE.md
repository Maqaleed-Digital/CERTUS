Data Capital (Foundation Extension – Data Asset & Evidence Signal Fabric) provides sovereign data residency, disclosure layering (L1/L2/L3), clean-room collaboration, and evidence-based signal outputs to Trust Domains. Adoption is optional and must not create runtime dependencies between Trust Domains. This extension does not introduce custody, lending, payment initiation, or autonomous AML decisioning, and must not activate deferred capabilities without explicit Epic Pivot + Gate approval.
