# CERTUS

Transaction Certainty Infrastructure — governance, controls, and operator-grade deployment discipline.

This repository bootstraps:
- Pre-production verification gate workflow
- Controlled manual deployment workflow with environment approvals
- Operator-first documentation

No business logic is hosted here unless explicitly intended.
